# Database Problems Solving (SQL and Pandas)

This repository contains solutions to various database problems, including SQL queries and their Pandas equivalents. The solutions cover a wide range of SQL databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and others. The goal is to help learners practice SQL and Pandas skills through real-world examples.

## Introduction

This repository is designed to provide solutions for various database-related problems using SQL and Pandas (Python's DataFrame library). The problems cover different database management systems (DBMS), and solutions are presented in both SQL syntax for relational databases and Pandas code for Python developers.

## Problem Categories

The problems in this repository include, but are not limited to:

- Basic SQL Queries
- Join Operations (Inner Join, Left Join, etc.)
- Aggregation and Grouping
- Subqueries and Nested Queries
- Complex SQL Queries (Using Window Functions, CTEs, etc.)
- Database Schema Design
- Data Manipulation with Pandas

Each problem typically contains:

- A brief problem statement.
- Example data and expected output.
- SQL and Pandas solutions.
- Explanation of the logic used to solve the problem.

## Database Types

This repository includes solutions for the following database systems:

- **MySQL**: SQL queries for MySQL databases.
- **PostgreSQL**: SQL queries for PostgreSQL databases.
- **Oracle**: SQL queries for Oracle databases.
- **SQL Server**: SQL queries for Microsoft SQL Server.
- **SQLite**: SQL queries for SQLite databases.
- **Pandas (Python)**: Python-based solutions using the Pandas library.

Each solution is written to ensure compatibility with the respective database system's SQL syntax.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: Queries for relational databases.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **MySQL**: A popular open-source relational database.
- **SQL Server**: A relational database management system developed by Microsoft.
- **Oracle Database**: A multi-model database management system produced by Oracle Corporation.
- **Pandas (Python)**: A fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python.
