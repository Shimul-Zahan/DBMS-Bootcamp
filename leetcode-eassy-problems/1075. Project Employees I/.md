# Project Employees I

**Problem**  
You are given two tables, `Project` and `Employee`, with the following schemas:

### Table: Project
| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| project_id  | int  |
| employee_id | int  |

- `(project_id, employee_id)` is the primary key of this table.
- `employee_id` is a foreign key referencing the `Employee` table.
- Each row indicates that the employee with `employee_id` is working on the project with `project_id`.

### Table: Employee
| Column Name      | Type    |
|------------------|---------|
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |

- `employee_id` is the primary key of this table.
- Each row contains information about one employee, and it is guaranteed that `experience_years` is not `NULL`.

### Task  
Write an SQL query to report the average experience years of all employees for each project, rounded to **two decimal places**.

Return the result in any order.

### Example
#### Input:
**Project**
| project_id | employee_id |
|------------|-------------|
| 1          | 1           |
| 1          | 2           |
| 1          | 3           |
| 2          | 1           |
| 2          | 4           |

**Employee**
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |

#### Output:
| project_id | average_years |
|------------|---------------|
| 1          | 2.00          |
| 2          | 2.50          |

### Explanation
- Project `1` includes employees with IDs `1`, `2`, and `3`. Their experience years are `3`, `2`, and `1`, respectively. The average is `(3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00`.
- Project `2` includes employees with IDs `1` and `4`. Their experience years are `3` and `2`, respectively. The average is `(3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50`.
