-- Select the 'id' from the 'Weather' table where the temperature of the current day is greater than the previous day
select w1.id
from Weather w1
-- Perform a self-join on the 'Weather' table, where 'w1' represents the current day's data and 'w2' represents the previous day's data
join Weather w2 
-- The join condition ensures that we match 'w1.recordDate' with the previous day's date ('w2.recordDate' + 1 day)
on w1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(w2.recordDate, interval 1 day)
-- The WHERE clause filters the result to only include rows where the current day's temperature is higher than the previous day's temperature
where w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
